    alt="presentation" /><p>Short version: Adventurer. DayDreamer. Harry Potter Enthusiast. Aspiring Web Developer.</p>
    <p>
      Long version: I am currently competing an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp. The end goal?
      Become a Full Stack Web Developer. Now, how did I get here? After college, having no clue
      what I wanted to do, I did as anyone would, traveled Europe. Upon my return, my problem (obviously)
      had not been solved. Then I did something I have always wanted to do, move to Boston. In Boston I
      helped my company shape/create the role of the Recruiter. During this, I learned some invaluable
      skills. </p>

      <p>
      Spending barley a year in Boston, I found myself missing my home state of Montana and the general
      friendliness of the west coast and decided to move back. After working in the HR/Recruiting field, I
      realized it was not the right path for me and started looking for other career avenues. I have always
      been curious by technology and started to consider how that could play a role in my career. Being a
      curious person, I began to teach myself how to code and became fascinated at the endless learning possibilities.
      After a few weeks, I started searching for a more structured learning environment and was excited to find
      the Big Sky Code Academy which allowed me to stay in MT and learn to code. The rest as they say, is history.</p>

      <p>
    Iâ€™m hoping to find a position working with a team where I can help solve problems and make meaningful contributions,
    while also continuing to push myself as developer. When I am not trying to fulfill my goals as a Web Developer you can
    find me running around in the mountains, enjoying a glass of cider with friends or reading a book. </p>
